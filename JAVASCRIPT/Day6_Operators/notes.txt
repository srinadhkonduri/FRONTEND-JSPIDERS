ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
-> add => 2 + 4 = 6, 
subtract => 4 - 2 = 2, 
multiply => 5*2 = 10, 
divide => 4/2 = 2 => remainder, 
modulus => 5%2 = 1 => quotient, 
negate -(5) => -5

COMPARISON OPERATORS
. a == b -> returns true if both the values are the same.
. a != b -> returns false if both the values add the same.
. a > b -> true if a is greater than b.
. a < b -> true if a is less than b.
. a >= b -> true if a is greater than or equal to b.
. a <= b -> true if a is less than or equal to b.
